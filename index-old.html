Burgess</p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p004"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn001">1</span> Old Mother West Wind had stopped to
          talk with the Slender Fir Tree. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p005"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn002">2</span> “I’ve just come across
          the Green Meadows,” said Old Mother West Wind, “and there I saw
          the Best Thing in the World.” </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p006"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn003">3</span> Striped Chipmunk was sitting under
          the Slender Fir Tree and he couldn’t help hearing what Old Mother West
          Wind said. “The Best Thing in the World—now what can that
          be?” thought Striped Chipmunk. “Why, it must be heaps and heaps of
          nuts and acorns! I’ll go and find it.” </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p007"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn004">4</span> So Striped Chipmunk started down the
          Lone Little Path through the wood as fast as he could run. Pretty soon he met
          Peter Rabbit. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p008"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn005">5</span> “Where are you going in such a
          hurry, Striped Chipmunk?” asked Peter Rabbit. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p009"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn006">6</span> “Down in the Green Meadows to
          find the Best Thing in the World,” replied Striped Chipmunk, and ran
          faster. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p010"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn007">7</span> “The Best Thing in the
          World,” said Peter Rabbit, “why, that must be a great pile of
          carrots and cabbage! I think I’ll go and find it.” </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p011"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn008">8</span> So Peter Rabbit started down the Lone
          Little Path through the wood as fast as he could go after Striped Chipmunk. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p012"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn009">9</span> As they passed the great hollow tree
          Bobby Raccoon put his head out. “Where are you going in such a
          hurry?” asked Bobby Raccoon. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p013"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn010">10</span> “Down in the Green Meadows to
          find the Best Thing in the World!” shouted Striped Chipmunk and Peter
          Rabbit, and both began to run faster. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p014"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn011">11</span> “The Best Thing in the
          World,” said Bobby Raccoon to himself, “why, that must be a whole
          field of sweet milky corn! I think I’ll go and find it.” </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p015"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn012">12</span> So Bobby Raccoon climbed down out of
          the great hollow tree and started down the Lone Little Path through the wood as
          fast as he could go after Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit, for there is
          nothing that Bobby Raccoon likes to eat so well as sweet milky corn. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p016"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn013">13</span> At the edge of the wood they met
          Jimmy Skunk. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p017"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn014">14</span> “Where are you going in such
          a hurry?” asked Jimmy Skunk. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p018"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn015">15</span> “Down in the Green Meadows to
          find the Best Thing in the World!” shouted Striped Chipmunk and Peter
          Rabbit and Bobby Raccoon. Then they all tried to run faster. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p019"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn016">16</span> “The Best Thing in the
          World,” said Jimmy Skunk. “Why, that must be packs and packs of
          beetles!” And for once in his life Jimmy Skunk began to hurry down the
          Lone Little Path after Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Raccoon. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p020"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn017">17</span> They were all running so fast that
          they didn’t see Reddy Fox until he jumped out of the long grass and
          asked: </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p021"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn018">18</span> “Where are you going in such
          a hurry?” </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p022"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn019">19</span> “To find the Best Thing in
          the World!” shouted Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Raccoon and
          Jimmy Skunk, and each did his best to run faster. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p023"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn020">20</span> “The Best Thing in the
          World,” said Reddy Fox to himself. “Why, that must be a whole pen
          full of tender young chickens, and I must have them.” </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p024"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn021">21</span> So away went Reddy Fox as fast as he
          could run down the Lone Little Path after Striped Chipmunk, Peter Rabbit, Bobby
          Raccoon and Jimmy Skunk. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p025"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn022">22</span> By and by they all came to the house
          of Johnny Chuck. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p026"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn023">23</span> “Where are you going in such
          a hurry?” asked Johnny Chuck. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p027"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn024">24</span> “To find the Best Thing in
          the World,” shouted Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Raccoon and
          Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p028"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn025">25</span> “The Best Thing in the
          World,” said Johnny Chuck. “Why I don’t know of anything
          better than my own little home and the warm sunshine and the beautiful blue
          sky.” </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p029"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn026">26</span> So Johnny Chuck stayed at home and
          played all day among the flowers with the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother
          West Wind and was as happy as could be. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p030"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn027">27</span> But all day long Striped Chipmunk
          and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Raccoon and Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox ran this way and
          ran that way over the Green Meadows trying to find the Best Thing in the World.
          The sun was very, very warm and they ran so far and they ran so fast that they
          were very, very hot and tired, and still they hadn’t found the Best Thing
          in the World. </p><p class="passage_para"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn028">28</span><span id="psga_p031"> When the long day was over they
          started up the Lone Little Path past Johnny Chuck’s house to their own
          homes. They didn’t hurry now for they were so very, very tired! And they
          were cross</span>—<span id="psga_p031a">oh so cross! Striped Chipmunk hadn’t found a single
          nut. Peter Rabbit hadn’t found so much as the leaf of a cabbage. Bobby
          Raccoon hadn’t found the tiniest bit of sweet milky corn. Jimmy Skunk
          hadn’t seen a single beetle. Reddy Fox hadn’t heard so much as the
          peep of a chicken. And all were as hungry as hungry could be.</span></p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p032"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn029">29</span> Half way up the Lone Little Path
          they met Old Mother West Wind going to her home behind the hill. “Did you
          find the Best Thing in the World?” asked Old Mother West Wind. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p033"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn030">30</span> “No!” shouted Striped
          Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Raccoon and Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox all
          together. </p><p class="passage_para" id="psga_p034"><span class="badge badge-inverse" id="psga_spn031">31</span> “Johnny Chuck has it,”
          said Old Mother West Wind. “It is being happy with the things you have
          and not wanting things which some one else has. And it is called
          Con-tent-ment.” </p><br><p id="psga_p035">From OLD MOTHER WEST WIND by Thorton W. Burgess—Public Domain</p></div></div>
